Let's Dish! App

Let's Dish! App - is an amazing app that allows users to keep track of the best dishes at resturants and food trucks in your area. Users can share their favorite dishes at the favorite local eateries by uploading descriptions (and images coming soon!). Let's Dish! App is a working full-stack application, using the MERN stack: Node.js, Mongoose, Express and React. Users are able to post new dishes they wish to share. They can read posts made by other users.
